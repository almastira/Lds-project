# Decision-Support-Systems

Final project for the university course "Laboratorie for Data Science"

 In Part 1 of the project, you are required to create and populate a database starting from
 different files and perform some operations on it. In the following, you can find a set of
 incremental assignments, each one with a brief description of what you are required to
 produce and what tools you can use for the task

  In Part 2 of the project you are required to solve some problems on the database you created
 in Part 1. Solve the exercises using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) with computation
 on the client side (i.e., do not use any SQL command in the nodes, only standard SSIS nodes).

In Part 3 of the project, you have to answer some business questions on a datacube you
 will create on the database you prepared. Document how you build your datacube in your
 report and solve the business questions using MultiDimensional eXpressions (MDX) in SQL
 management studio.
